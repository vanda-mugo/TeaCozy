# Tea Cozy

## Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy

In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

## Design Spec

## Images

- Logo
- Bedford Bizarre
- Berry Blitz
- Donut
- Locations
- Background
- Myrtle Ave
- Spiced Rum

Make sure to include the provided images in the correct locations as outlined in the design spec.
